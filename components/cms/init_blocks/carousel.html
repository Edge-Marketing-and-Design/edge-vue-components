SUPPORTED DATA ATTRIBUTES (on [data-carousel]):

- data-carousel-autoplay
  Enable autoplay (off by default).

- data-carousel-interval="MS"
  Milliseconds between slides for autoplay. Default: 5000.

- data-carousel-loop
  Enable looping. In our init we disable "containScroll" when loop is on, so it can wrap.

- data-carousel-transition="fade"
  Use Embla's fade plugin (best for single-slide view). Omit for multi-slide carousels.

- data-carousel-fade-duration="MS"
  Fade transition duration in ms when transition="fade". Default: 400.

- data-carousel-no-pause
  Prevent autoplay from pausing on hover/focus.

- data-carousel-slides-to-scroll="N"
  Base slidesToScroll (mobile). Default: 1.

- data-carousel-slides-to-scroll-md="N"
  slidesToScroll at ≥768px (Tailwind md breakpoint).

- data-carousel-slides-to-scroll-lg="N"
  slidesToScroll at ≥1024px (Tailwind lg breakpoint).

- data-carousel-slides-to-scroll-xl="N"
  slidesToScroll at ≥1280px (Tailwind xl breakpoint).

CHILD SELECTORS:

- [data-carousel-track]
  The slide track container (display:flex). Keep overflow clipping on the ROOT, not here.

- [data-carousel-prev] / [data-carousel-next]
  Optional buttons. In loop mode we keep them enabled; we also manually wrap when hitting edges.

- [data-carousel-dots]
  Optional container; we build dots from Embla's "snap list" (respects slidesToScroll & breakpoints).

LAYOUT NOTES:

- For deterministic N-up widths, use flex-basis directly:
    • 1-up mobile →   class="flex-[0_0_100%]"
    • 3-up ≥lg   →   class="lg:flex-[0_0_33.333%]"
  (You can also do basis-full/lg:basis-1/3 + shrink-0, but flex-[0_0_*] is the most reliable with carousels.)

- Root/viewport should have overflow-hidden. Track should be flex without overflow-hidden.

- Multi-up + loop behavior:
    • Looping feels best when you have more slides than visible. With 3-up and only 4 slides it still works,
      but snaps are limited (often just 0 and 1). We added a control "wrap" so Next at the end jumps back to 0
      and Prev at the start jumps to the last snap.
    • Dots represent snaps, not slides. With slidesToScroll=1 at 3-up, expect more frequent dots; with 3 they
      represent pages.

- If your layout adapts to container width (not viewport), use Tailwind container queries:
    Wrap the carousel in a "@container" parent, and use classes like "@[1024px]:flex-[0_0_33.333%]".

TYPICAL SETUPS:

- Single-slide with fade:
    data-carousel-transition="fade"
    data-carousel-fade-duration="800"
    slides use flex-[0_0_100%]

- Multi-slide desktop paging by 3:
    data-carousel-slides-to-scroll="1"
    data-carousel-slides-to-scroll-lg="3"
    slides use flex-[0_0_100%] lg:flex-[0_0_33.333%]
